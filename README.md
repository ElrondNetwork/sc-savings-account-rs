# sc-savings-account-rs

Savings Account design for Elrond Network, in which we use Liquid Staking positions from the Delegation SCs as borrow payment (through Semi-Fungible Tokens), and we lend stablecoins.  

Some modules are copied and slightly modified from the Lending/Borrowing SCs: https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-lend-rs
